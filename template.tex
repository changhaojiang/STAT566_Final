\subsection{R-learner}\label{r-learner}}

In this section, we investigate the heterogeneous effects of lifestyle
factors on subgroups defined by age, sex, and income using the R-learner
(Nie and Wager, 2017). This approach utilizes machine learning to
estimate treatment effects in observational studies.

The R-learner is used to estimate the Conditional Average Treatment
Effect (CATE),
\(\tau^*(z_1,z_2,z_3) = E(Y(1)-Y(0)|Z_1=z_1,Z_2 = z_2,Z_3 = z_3)\), with
\(Z_1\), \(Z_2\), and \(Z_3\) denoting individual features (age, income,
and gender) and \(Y_i\) the observed outcome.

Using the \(\texttt{rlasso}\) method in \(\texttt{rlearner}\), we input
age, gender, and income as features, and a categorical score as the
treatment variable, with diabetes presence indicating observed response.
The algorithm of R-learner also includes cross-validation, we set it
with ten folds. Finally, we visualize CATE CATE across income levels,
gender, and age groups.

In the visualization of CATE across different income groups, we observe
a correlation between higher income and a larger average treatment
effect within the same income bracket. This trend is particularly
pronounced among individuals earning over \$50,000 annually, where the
mean effect significantly surpasses that of other groups.

When comparing CATE across genders, it is noteworthy that the average
treatment effect for females is lower than that for males.

The CATE across age groups shows a distinct decline as age increases.
For individuals younger than 24, there is little discernible difference
in the outcome between those maintaining good or poor lifestyles.

\section{Results}\label{results}}

From the R-learner plots, we discern that higher income individuals are
less likely to develop diabetes, even have poor lifestyle choices. This
pattern is particularly noticeable for those earning over \$50,000
annually. Regarding gender, the difference in diabetes risk between good
and poor lifestyle habits is more pronounced in females than males,
underscoring the importance of healthy habits for women. In terms of
age, the substantial variation in CATE across different age groups
suggests that maintaining a healthy lifestyle becomes increasingly vital
as one ages. This is because poor lifestyle choices are more likely to
induce diabetes as age increases.
